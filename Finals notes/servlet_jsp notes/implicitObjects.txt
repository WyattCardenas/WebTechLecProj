Implicit Objects

These Objects are the Java objects that the JSP Container makes available to the developers in each page and the 
developer can call them directly without being explicitly declared.

request - whenever a client requests a page the JSP engine creates a new object to represent that request.

        - The request object provides methods to get the HTTP header information including form data, cookies, HTTP methods etc.

response - when a request is created it also creates an object to represent the response to the client.
          
         - The response object also defines the interfaces that deal with creating new HTTP headers.
         
         - Through this object the JSP programmer can add new cookies or date stamps, HTTP status codes, etc.
 
out - used to send content in a response.

    out.print(dataType dt) - Print a data type value

    out.println(dataType dt) - Print a data type value then terminate the line with new line character.

    out.flush() - Flush the stream.

session - behaves exactly the same way that session objects behave under Java Servlets.
        - used to track client session between client requests.

application - a representation of the JSP page through its entire lifecycle. 
            - created when the JSP page is initialized and will be removed when the JSP page is removed by the jspDestroy() method.

config - allows the JSP programmer access to the Servlet or JSP engine initialization parameters such as the paths or file locations etc.

pageContext -  The pageContext object is used to represent the entire JSP page.

            -  intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of the implementation details.

page - The page object is really a direct synonym for the this object.

exception - It is typically used to generate an appropriate response to the error condition.

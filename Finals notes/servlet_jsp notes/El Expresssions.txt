	       - are defined in more detail in Chapter JSP.2, “Expression Language”. 
	       - can be disabled through the use of JSP configuration elements and page directives; see Section JSP.1.10.1 and Section JSP.3.3.2, “Deactivating EL Evaluation”. 
	       - when not disabled, can be used anywhere within template data. 
	       - can be used in any attribute of a standard action that this specification indicates can accept a run-time expression value, and in any attribute of a custom action that has been indicated to accept run-time expressions (i.e. their associated <rtexprvalue> in the TLD is true; see Appendix JSP.C).
